This is the Rock Band Thing!

Server Setup:
- You'll need a mysql database. Set it up with the sql scripts in the db folder.
- The web files go on a web server somewhere that has php5.
- Edit web/api/rb3.inc with your database setup.
- Edit client/process.php with your server URL.
- Everything should work now..

Client Process:
- Run download.php to download the current score files from Harmonix.
- It stores the downloads in the data folder
- gunzip everything in data, overwriting old stuff if there.
- Run process.php to process the data and upload the scores to the server.
- Update the timestamps in server/web/queryScores.php (see comment there, and notes file)
